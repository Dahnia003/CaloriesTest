The proposed Calories Tracking DMS aims to help users track their calorie intake and estimate calorie burn during different activities, 
and ensure they are meeting their fitness goals. 
This system will allow users to log food items and exercise data, then it will calculate calorie deficits or surpluses to help them meet their fitness goals 
such as weight gain or weight loss.
